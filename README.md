#  Food App Built using MERN Stack
The  Food App is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, with an added touch of Tailwind CSS for efficient styling..  It provides a seamless and intuitive platform for users to browse, search, and order their favorite dishes.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: The app supports user registration and authentication, allowing users to create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles.

- **Search and Filtering**: The app offers a powerful search functionality, enabling users to search for specific dishes, restaurants, or cuisines. They can also apply filters based on price, ratings, and dietary preferences.

- **Menu Management**: Restaurants can easily manage their menus, including adding new dishes, updating prices, and removing items that are out of stock.

- **Cart and Checkout**: Users can add items to their cart, customize their orders, and proceed to the checkout process, where they can review their order details and choose their preferred payment method.

- **Order Tracking**: Users can track the status of their orders in real-time, receiving updates on their order's preparation, delivery, and estimated arrival time.


## Tech Stack

The MERN Food App is built using the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store and manage the app's data, such as user information, restaurant details, menus, orders, and reviews.

- **Express**: A minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js, providing robust routing and middleware capabilities.

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create the app's frontend components and handle client-side rendering.

- **Node.js**: A server-side JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, allowing for the development of server-side and networking applications.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid and efficient UI development. Tailwind CSS provides a comprehensive set of pre-designed utility classes that can be easily combined to style the app's components.




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
